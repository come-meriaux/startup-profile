			Our company aims to propose a personalized diagnosis of your skin thanks to facial sensors, to then advise you with the help of an artificial intelligence of cosmetic products adapted to your needs.

			<li>According to Steve Jobs, artificial intelligence "is the innovation that separates leaders from followers."</li>
			<li>"The French cosmetics sector posts 14.5 billion euros in exports and confirms its role as a world leader".</li>

		<h2>What is our project?</h2>
			<p>
		The question was to integrate artificial intelligence into cosmetics. For this we imagined the installation of different sensors, two or three, in HighCosmetic stores. Customers carry out a test of a few minutes on these same sensors. It is at this precise moment that the AI intervenes by offering the customer up to three products adapted to his skin.

		<h2>What is AI?</h2>
			<p>In a world increasingly developed and oriented towards robotization and automation. High Cosmetics bases its ambitions on a major innovation that will transform the future: artificial intelligence. According to Dominique Pastre, Professor of Computer Science at the University of Paris 5, "Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the science whose goal is to make a machine do tasks that man accomplishes using his intelligence."</p>
